# Weather-prediction
Project to predict weather of a day entered by user using Machine Learning (Linear Regression Algorithm) trained using Austin, Texas dataset.
# Linear Regression 
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.
Linear Regression Analysis consists of more than just fitting a linear line through a cloud of data points. 
# It consists of 3 stages â€“ 
1. analyzing the correlation and directionality of the data.
2. estimating the model, i.e., fitting the line.
3. evaluating the validity and usefulness of the model.

# List of things it predicts for the day entered
1. Rainfall
2. Average Temperature
3. Dew Point Average
4. Humidity average Percentage
5. Sea Level Pressure in inches
6. Visibility average in miles
7. Wind Average in MPH
# Dataset used:
Austin, Texas from Kaggle
